## PyBer Analysis

### Overview

The purpose of the analysis is to determine the total fares of Q1 2019 and use the data to determine what adjustments can be made in each city type.

### Results

The urban city types had the highest number of drivers and rides as well as the the highest total fares, but the rural city types had the highest average fare per ride and driver. The rural cities must have a higher average fare per driver due to the lower ride count, otherwise, drivers couldn't afford to driver for PyBer. The distances are likely further on average and would be more expensive per ride because of this. The Suburban city types are in the middle for all categories, and this is expected.

### Summary

Hiring more drivers in rural cities would make it possible to lower the fare rate in those cities, potentially raising the total ride count and decreasing the average fare per ride/driver, as people would be more inclined to pay the increased cost. In urban cities, the fare price could be raised, increasing the average fare per driver/ride, and decreasing the total ride count, as people would be less inclined to pay the extra cost. Some suburban cities have relatively small driver counts compared  to other suburban cities. Increased hiring efforts in these cities could lower average fare cost, but it may not be necessary in all suburban cities.
